# Nifty200Momentum30Selection
Function to select the 30 stocks that make up the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index

Takes input as the rebalancing month (either June or December). Returns the 30 stocks that make up the Index. Note that it won't be entirely accurate because NSE considers stocks that have had a corporate event in the past 12 months to be ineligible for inclusion in the index. Apart from those stocks, most of the selection by the function is accurate.
